                        The CGRS Dataset is an unprecedented large-scale CG image dataset of retail shelves. It includes 200 classes of retail products and 100000 images. By using automatic annotation using 3DCG, we have achieved an overwhelming increase in scale compared to existing retail product shelf datasets.
