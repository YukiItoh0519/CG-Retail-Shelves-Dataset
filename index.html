                        The CGRS Dataset is an unprecedented large-scale CG image dataset of retail shelves. It includes 200 classes of retail products and 100000 images. By using automatic annotation using 3DCG, we have achieved an overwhelming increase in scale compared to existing retail product shelf datasets.

                        In the 200 types of retail products we selected for creating the dataset, there are many items under the same brand with different flavors (thus, with package designs that closely resemble each other). We believe that the dataset we have created this time poses more challenging problems compared to existing datasets.

                        We not only meticulously modeled retail products and shelves, but also established parameters considering physical aspects such as reflectance, and synthesized photorealistic CG images. Moreover, by adjusting lighting setups, we replicated real-world scenarios, depicting effects like saturation due to light reflection in some images.
